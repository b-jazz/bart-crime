<h1 class="display-3 text-center">Bart Crimes</h1>
<h2 class="text-center">Making Public Informaion Public</h2>


    <p>In spite of a <a>recent initiative</a> to "increase public's access to BART crime data", they
    have in fact been <a>reducing the amount of crime information they publish</a> information because <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/07/25/bart-officials-withhold-crime-surveillance-tapes-for-fear-racial-stereotyping-memo-shows.html">fear
        of racial sterotyping</a>
        . While I agree with the notion that i
    would be a shame if racial biases are formed for any reason, I am of the firm belief that 
    it is not BART's job to hide information from us. <b>Nor is it their right.</b></p>

    <p>BART has reduced their daily crime updates to a mailing list which requires approval. This information
    is scraped from those daily emails and posted. <b>I only have emails back to July 22, 2017. If anyone has more, please <a href="http://www.bugben.com">reach out to me</a>.</b></p>

    <p>I created this site while sitting on BART for my daily commute back and forth Fremont
    to San Francisco. I've seen a lot of crazy things on that commute, and I think security is
    in serious need of some attention. Particularly gate security. I'd venture to say a huge
    percent of the negative press BART is getting is by the same people I see hopping the 
    fare gate on daily basis. Nothing is ever done about it.</p>

    <p>I love BART, but I've had it with the overly-aggressive begging, bodily fluids, needles, and I see on a daily basis.</p>
